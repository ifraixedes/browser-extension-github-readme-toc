Github README ToC browser-extension
========================

This is a browser extension which allows to show you a "table of content" generated by the readme file in the root page of any [GitHub](https://github.com) project.

## What about

I have created this extension because I found that it would very handy to have a table of content of the readme file, which is shown in any GitHub project's root page, to jump through the sections without scrolling manually up and down or use the browser search action at the same time that you have to remember how it is called; so this extension provides that.

## Implementation

The extension doesn't have any dependency so, it is very simple and the implementation is so straight forward.

### Browser extension available
* [Google Chrome / Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-readme-toc/lbmealnkdpmndleijdkljlofnmgmpcdf)

## TODO
* Generated an extension, add-on or whatever name which they receive in other browsers. Between them, there are [FireFox](http://firefox.com), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/), [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/internet-explorer/download-ie), any other else is welcome as well.
